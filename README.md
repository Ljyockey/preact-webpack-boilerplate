A boilerplate to get up-and-running with preact.

* [preact](https://preactjs.com/)

**DEV DEPENDENCIES**

Please note that this is a project I did to better understand how to optimize the build process with a very specific enterprise codebase.
That being said, some of node packages are out of date. I have not yet looked into the breaking changes between my version and the latest version of these dependencies, if any. I will update to the latest version ASAP.
